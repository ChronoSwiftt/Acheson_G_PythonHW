# Rock Paper Scissors in Python

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to play

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory -`cd directory name`- and run the -`game.py`- file in a Python 3 Terminal window for macOS/Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

*Choose your weapon wisely!*

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts

Built with Python 3.
